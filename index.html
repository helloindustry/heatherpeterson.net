                    The pieces I have selected are four of the most joy-filled thrilling pieces I have ever studied, and it is my pleasure to play them for you. It is my sincere hope that we would each come away from these evenings with a deep sense of peace, feeling refreshed and even experiencing some healing in our souls.

                    From infancy, music has gripped me as a source of beauty, delight, and joy, pointing always to something greater than itself.  It is for this reason I spent many hundreds of hours practicing at the piano as a child and young adult, and for this reason still I wish to offer this simple gift as salve to soothe our souls after such a difficult year in our history and in our community.

                    <br/>
                    We all can benefit from taking some time out to allow ourselves to  take a deep breath, reset our minds, become present, and really see the beauty and gift that lies in simple life in front of us, even amidst pain, loss, and grief.

                Heather Peterson is a passionate and qualified professional pianist and private teacher with a high level of professional experience and a deep life experience. She delights in bringing this to performances, worship times, and lessons, helping each student access, develop, and release his or her unique voice into musical expression.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Heather holds a master&#x27;s degree in piano performance from the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in piano from Northern Illinois University. She has been teaching private piano lessons from her own studio for over 25 years, held music and choral teaching positions at Aletheia Classical Academy in Peoria, held piano and coursework teaching positions at Illinois Central College, performed with rock band 
                <a href="https://helloindustry.com" target="_blank">Hello Industry</a>
                 for 20 years, has led worship at numerous formal and informal church gatherings, held a volunteer position for a year as coach/spiritual mentor for a youth worship band, and loves collaborating with musicians of all types.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In her youth Heather began giving full-length solo recitals at the age of eight, and often placed as finalist or winner of many regional, national and international piano competitions, performing publicly as a soloist and competition winner with the NIU Philharmonic Orchestra, the Anderson Symphony Orchestra, and others. Heather recently began composing music, and gave her first full-length concert of original work in February 2020.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Her present concert, Classical Offering: Music in The Time of Covid, is an exploration into her past, from a new and deeper place, performing pieces studied during her collegiate years, before raising her own family. This concert has taken 3 years to prepare, and is much like the metaphorical phoenix rising from the ashes. After the tragic life and death of her fourth child, Olivia, a Trisomy-18 baby that lived, Heather&#x27;s journey through grief and soul-searching manifested through artistic expressions of music and writings, eventually returning to studying classical piano repertoire, from a richer place than ever capable before.
